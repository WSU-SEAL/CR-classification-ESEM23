        is specially formulated for use by update_from_provider_tree.  Like the
        other method, we DO need to _ensure_resource_class - i.e. automatically
        create new resource classes specified in the inv_data.  However, UNLIKE
        the other method:
        - We don't use the DELETE API when inventory is empty, because that guy
          doesn't return content, and we need to update the cached provider
          tree with the new generation.
        - We raise exceptions (rather than returning a boolean) which are
          handled in a consistent fashion by update_from_provider_tree.
        - We don't invalidate the cache on failure.  That's controlled at a
          broader scope (based on errors from ANY of the set_*_for_provider
          methods, etc.) by update_from_provider_tree.
        - We don't retry.  In this code path, retries happen at the level of
          the resource tracker on the next iteration.
        - We take advantage of the cache and no-op if inv_data isn't different
          from what we have locally.  This is an optimization, not essential.
        - We don't _ensure_resource_provider or refresh_and_get_inventory,
          because that's already been done in the code paths leading up to
          update_from_provider_tree (by get_provider_tree).  This is an
          optimization, not essential.
