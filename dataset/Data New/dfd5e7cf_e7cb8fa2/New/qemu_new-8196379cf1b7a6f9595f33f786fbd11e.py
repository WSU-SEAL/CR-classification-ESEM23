    # on persistent storage when the command exits. Without (2), a host crash
    # may leave a corrupt image in the image cache, which Nova cannot recover
    # automatically.

    # filesystem that doesn't have support for O_DIRECT, which is the case
    # for example with tmpfs. This simply crashes "openstack server create"
    # in environments like live distributions. In such case, the best choice
    # is writethrough, which is power-failure safe, but still faster than
    # writeback.
